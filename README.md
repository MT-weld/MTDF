# SDL/WES/DIS Dataset
Datasets  can be found at [BaiduYun Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XbtjL58-aiNg1DxeQo6hmQ?pwd=wm4e) (code: wm4e)
# Main results
The main experimental results are provided in [BaiduYun Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-qM-CVTsBcnjglNJwNkLyQ?pwd=w4ho) (code: w4ho)

# Training
1. Download the pre-trained model Swin-T [BaiduYun Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cIX3ruaQqEG6jgb9yCWDqg) (code: 6686)
2. Modify the configuration in `main.py`
3. Run `python main.py` to start training
# Testing
1. Modify the configuration in `main.py` and `utils.py`
2. Run `python main.py` to start testing

This paper improves and innovates on the basis of RCN.
